# sentiment-analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a text to determine the writer’s attitude towards a particular topic or idea. The number of likes and dislikes for a video will also be outputted for the purpose of providing additional data to support the comment sentiment analysis. 

This information can be used by YouTubers to improve their content and it can be used by viewers as an indicator of the quality of a video. The information provided by this project can also be useful to companies that advertise on YouTube. The company can analyze the viewers’ opinions and improve either its products, services or advertisements accordingly. This project is implemented in Python due to its data and language processing capabilities and its compatibility with YouTube.

To run:
python sentiment.py
